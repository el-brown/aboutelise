        <!-- Establish a mission statement.  Live my best life doing something I love
            State your "aha!" moment.  My sister helped me realize that I can start a career in coding and that I'd be great at it.
            Explain who you serve.  Jesus is my spiritual guide. I love who he is and what he represents. I want to serve people like he did.  Healing people and the earth.
            Explain what you're offering them.  Emotional intelligence, drive and smarts
            Cite examples of who you've served.  I've served BBBS and am creating a project to serve families.
            Describe your values.  My highest values are honesty, understanding, -->
