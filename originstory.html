  <!-- How to write your origin story:

Start with the now. Journal. Who you are, what’s your superpower. 
Where you’ve arrived. What is your expertise? You can have several 
origin stories. 
Go back to the beginning. Pivot back and find the story from your 
life that’s most relevant to setting up the origin story, sets up 
your expertise. (Think about the ending). Building a story from 3-4 
key anecdotes of your life. All stories have beginnings, middles, 
and ends. How you broke through to the other side, build to the 
ending you desire.
After you tell the anecdote, reflect. Pull the meaning out of the 
anecdote. Ask: “How do I feel now about how I felt then, and how 
do I think now about how I thought then.” (retrospection) It brings 
out the lessons you learned. 
Write your way to the next anecdote with a transition. All anecdotes
lead to your superpower. 

Emphasis is on humanity and simplicity of it. You don’t always have 
to be serious either. Lean on some humor and some way to see that 
there were luck and persistence involved but you got there anyway.-->
