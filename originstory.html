  <h2>My Origin Story</h2>
  <p>I was born and mostly raised in Utah. My favorite
    places to live were Springville and Salem.  Springville was
    full of flowers, walnut and cherry trees, and a beautiful old
    woman we called Grandma Lou. I felt free to wander the neighborhood
    and creatively express with my friends.  My memories of Salem
    are of baby goats named after Star Wars characters,
    endless time with cousins, and riding my bike everywhere I could.
    I love the land: gardens, country, animals. I love being rooted
    in the earth, myself, and my family- both living and those who've
    passed.  I have a tattoo up my spine, a wildflower, the stem 
    is made up of the names of my maternal line up starting with my 3rd great
    grandmother and ending with me.  Being centered and rooted is a huge 
    part of who I am.
  </p>
  <p>My love of computers comes from my dad.  He had a fascination with them that started when his best friend's 
    parents bought one of the first desktop computers in the early 70's. 
    In 1989 when my older sister and I were babies and the family was broke 
    he was serendipitously able to aquire our first computer.  I loved that
    Mac.  I would play the game "Bonk" on it for hours if I was allowed.
    Later I got into text-adventure games and pinball on my grandpa's
    computer. Oregon Trail, email, chatrooms - I loved it all.  I learned to 
    type when I was 8 and when I was a teenager and my dad started a 
    website promotion business, I learned HTML and CSS to create and 
    optimize my first websites. </p>
  <p>In college I earned a Liberal Arts degree with a focus on leadership. 
    This helped me pull out of my shy shell and start being more proactive
    in my life. The liberal arts exist to help you become a well-rounded 
    person with a broad knowledge base and skills in communication, problem
    solving and critical thinking. It was a strong foundation that has 
    deeply impacted every part of my life. </p>
  <p>Programming appeals to me for many reasons.  I love rules, structure,
    and exactness.  If I can't learn, grow and improve things around me 
    I tend to get a little bored.  Programming fits my personality
    really well so when I was ready for a career my best friend suggested
    coding and my younger, cooler sibling who's a software engineer said
    they would mentor me. All the pieces came together at the right time and
    here I am :)

  <!-- How to write your origin story:

Start with the now. Journal. Who you are, what’s your superpower. 
Where you’ve arrived. What is your expertise? You can have several 
origin stories. 
Go back to the beginning. Pivot back and find the story from your 
life that’s most relevant to setting up the origin story, sets up 
your expertise. (Think about the ending). Building a story from 3-4 
key anecdotes of your life. All stories have beginnings, middles, 
and ends. How you broke through to the other side, build to the 
ending you desire.
After you tell the anecdote, reflect. Pull the meaning out of the 
anecdote. Ask: “How do I feel now about how I felt then, and how 
do I think now about how I thought then.” (retrospection) It brings 
out the lessons you learned. 
Write your way to the next anecdote with a transition. All anecdotes
lead to your superpower. 

Emphasis is on humanity and simplicity of it. You don’t always have 
to be serious either. Lean on some humor and some way to see that 
there were luck and persistence involved but you got there anyway.-->
