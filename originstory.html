        <img id="wonderland" src="images/elisewonderland.jpeg" alt="Elise in an Alice in Wonderland garden">
        <p>I was born and mostly raised in Utah. My favorite
          places to live were Springville and Salem.  Springville was
          full of flowers, walnut and cherry trees, and a beautiful old
          woman we called Grandma Lou. I felt free to wander the neighborhood
          and creatively express with my friends.  My memories of Salem
          are of baby goats named after Star Wars characters,
          endless time with cousins, and riding my bike everywhere I could.
          I love the land: gardens, country, animals. I love being rooted
          in the earth, myself, and my family- both living and those who've
          passed.  I have a tattoo up my spine, a wildflower, the stem 
          is made up of the names of my maternal line up starting with my 3rd great
          grandmother and ending with me.  Being centered and rooted is a huge 
          part of who I am.

        <h3 id="computers">Love of Computers</h3>
        <p>My love of computers comes from my dad.  He had a fascination with them that started when his best friend's 
          parents bought one of the first desktop computers in the early 70's. 
          In 1989 when my older sister and I were babies and the family was broke 
          he was serendipitously able to aquire our first computer.  I loved that
          Mac.  I would play the game "Bonk" on it for hours if I was allowed.
          Later I got into text-adventure games and pinball on my grandpa's
          computer. Oregon Trail, email, chatrooms - I loved it all.  I learned to 
          type when I was 8 and when I was a teenager and my dad started a 
          website promotion business, I learned HTML and CSS to create and 
          optimize my first websites. </p>
        <h3 id="education">Education</h3>
        <p>In college I earned a Liberal Arts degree with a focus on leadership. 
          This helped me pull out of my shy shell and start being more proactive
          in my life. The liberal arts exist to help you become a well-rounded 
          person with a broad knowledge base and skills in communication, problem
          solving and critical thinking. It was a strong foundation that has 
          deeply impacted every part of my life. </p>
        <h3 id="programming">Why Programming</h3>
        <p>Programming appeals to me for many reasons.  I love rules, structure,
          and exactness.  If I can't learn, grow and improve things around me 
          I tend to get a little bored.  Programming fits my personality
          really well so when I was ready for a career my best friend suggested
          coding and my younger, cooler sibling who's a software engineer said
          they would mentor me. All the pieces came together at the right time and
          here I am :)
