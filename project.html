        <p>My personal project is a gift I hope to give anyone who struggles
          spending too much time, money and energy on their meals. </p>
        <p>This project was inspired by my experience as a mother who worked hard to feed my family healthy
          meals every day. I saved money with these homemade meals but spent 
          too much time making menu plans and grocery lists. </p>
        <p>On the other extreme I'd find out that my husband spent a good chunk of our grocery budget
          on eating out when I was gone for the weekend.  We needed to find a balance.</p>
        <p>I was lucky to have
          the time to think through meals each week and plan for them but
          as my life got busier I couldn't do it anymore.  I started buying
          premade food and eating out more but it was much less healthy and
          didn't make me feel good.</p>  
        <p>So I came up with this system where we can have easy meals that are healthy, 
          inexpensive, and unplanned simply by making meals intuitive.</p>
        <p> <br />
          <h2>Intuitive Meal Planning</h2>
          The idea is that you learn to think of meals as a combination of 
          grains, protein, vegetables and sauces. Then...
          <ol id="list">
            <li>
              <p>Identify your favorite foods in each of these catagories. </p></li>
            <li>
              <p>Fill your pantry, fridge and freezer with all your favorites.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>Consult the app for basic dinner ideas in each of the following catagories:</p>
              <ol id="catagories">
                <li>Tacos/Burritos</li>
                <li>Stirfry</li>
                <li>Soup</li>
                <li>Salad</li>
                <li>Wraps</li>
                <li>Bowls</li>
                <li>Sheet Pan</li>
                <li>Pizza</li>
              </ol> 
            </li> 
          </ol>
          <b>Other ideas:</b> add your ingredients to a grocery list that connects 
          to Smith's website and puts them into your shopping cart.
