      <p>My personal project is a gift I hope to give anyone who struggles
        spending too much time, money and energy on their meals. </p>
      <p>Inspired by my experience as a mother who worked hard to feed my family healthy
        meals every day. I saved money with these homemade meals but spent 
        so much time making menu plans and grocery lists. </p>
      <p>And then on the other hand watching my husband spend a quarter of our grocery budget
        on eating out when I'm gone for the weekend.  </p>
      <p>I was lucky to have
        the time to think through meals each week and plan for them but
        as my life got busier I didn't want to do it anymore.  I started buying
        premade food and eating out more but that didn't make me feel good.</p>  
      <p>I came up with this system so we can have easy meals that are healthy
        and inexpensive. </p>
