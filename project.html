        <p>My personal project is a gift I hope to give anyone who struggles
          spending too much time, money and energy on their meals. </p>
        <p>This project was inspired by my experience as a mother who worked hard to feed my family healthy
          meals every day. I saved money with these homemade meals but spent 
          too much time making menu plans and grocery lists. </p>
        <p>On the other extreme I'd find out that my husband spent a good chunk of our grocery budget
          on eating out when I was gone for the weekend.  We needed to find a balance.</p>
        <p>I was lucky to have
          the time to think through meals each week and plan for them but
          as my life got busier I couldn't do it anymore.  I started buying
          premade food and eating out more but it was much less healthy and
          didn't make me feel good.</p>  
        <p>So I came up with this system where we can have easy meals that are healthy
          and inexpensive, without much planning. </p>
